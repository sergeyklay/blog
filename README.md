# Serghei's blog

[![Netlify Status][netlify-badge]][deploy-status]

You're looking at the source code of [my brand-spanking new blog][blog],
permissively licensed for others to adapt.

## How to try it out

### Prerequisites

To play with this blog at your local environment you need the following
requirements:

- [Hugo][hugo] >= 0.95.0

---

First you need to get the project:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/sergeyklay/blog.git
$ cd blog
```

Then, from the root of the blog just run:

```shell
$ hugo server
```

Copy the url from your terminal log and paste it into your browser of choice.
This url usually looks something like this `http://localhost:1313`. At this
point you should be looking at your very own working version of my blog.

## Support

there is something you can't do with the Branch, please [open an issue][issues].
