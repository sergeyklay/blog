You're looking at the source code of my brand-spanking new blog.

## How to try it out

### Prerequisites

To play with this blog at your local environment you need the following requirements:

- Ruby >= 2.4.0

First you need to get the project:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sergeyklay/blog.git
cd blog
```

After that, we need a few ruby dependencies:

```bash
bundle install
```

Then, from the root of the blog just run:

This will start a server on port 4000.
