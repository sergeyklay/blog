# Serghei's blog

You're looking at the source code of my brand-spanking new blog.

## How to try it out

First you need to get the project:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:sergeyklay/blog.git
cd blog
```

After that, we need a few ruby dependencies:

```sh
bundle install
```

Then, from the root of the blog just run:

```sh
./serve
```

This will start a server on port 4000.
